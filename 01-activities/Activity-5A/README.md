This is Activity 5A Colliding circles.

In this activity I learn how to utilise the Ball class and dist() to check the space between two balls.
with the distance between two balls noted I created different effects that may occur when the balls collide eg. ripple ring effect around the ball, the ball colour changes.

In addition, I also learned how to use the keyPressed function which allow me to switch between two different colour ball regardless of the ball colliding with eachother.
